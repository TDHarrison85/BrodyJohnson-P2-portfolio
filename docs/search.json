Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project. For this template, there is just a a single folder, but having sub-folders is often a good idea."

These changes range from rule modifications to investment in advancements to the players pads and helmets. Hopefully, the findings from this project can help inform players, coaches, and who knows, the NFL about the metrics for a higher risk in injury."

The primary data set (“Injury Player Data” obtained from a Github repository contain 1,586 obervations) consists of every play ran in the NFL containing an injury during the 2019-2020 season. Some of the things contained in this data include the teams playing, the week in the season, play description, injury area, and injured player metrics. Two other data sets were obtained from Kaggle. The first is a “cumulative play data” containing information about every play ran in the 2019-2020 NFL season (42,186 observations). Information such as the teams playing, play description, and time in the game when it was ran. The last data set is the “player demographic data” containing information about all NFL players in the 2015-2019 seasons (11,145 observations). This data set has player metrics such as height, weight, date of birth, etc."

My hope is to answer the following question: What metrics, if any, are available that can help predict whether an injury may occur? In turn, this has the potential to answer more questions. For example: 1. For coaches, are there specific play types that lead to more injuries? 2. For players, is there a goal weight for certain positions that can reduce the liklihood of injury?\nTo cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here dataanalysis_template_references.bib) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:\nExamples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in (McKay, Ebell, Billings, et al., 2020; McKay, Ebell, Dale, Shen, & Handel, 2020)"

The big picture look at the analysis will be to compare the frequency of parameters in the injury data set to the same parameters in the two supporting data sets. For example, we may find in the injury data set that most injuries occur during “short pass” plays. However, if we were to find the “short pass” play is the most common play type ran in the NFL, this becomes less significant of a finding."

Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at C:/Users/Brody Johnson/Desktop/PracticumII-course/BrodyJohnson-P2-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

(This is often called a Codebook.) For this simple example, the codebook is given as a second sheet in the Excel file.\nThis raw data-set should generally not be edited by hand. It should instead be loaded and processed/cleaned using code."

Since those files might be used by several of the products, I’m placing them in the main products folder. Feel free to re-organize."

Before moving to San Antonio, I completed two internships in Saint Louis, MO and a co-op with Ford Motor Company in Kansas City, MO. In San Antonio, I work at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) evaluating fuels, engine oils, and driveline lubricants in automobiles with the use of SwRI’s Mileage Accumulation Dynamometer (MAD) facility. I also manage tests evaluating fuels for their performance such as the ASTM D6201 Standard Test Method for Dynamometer Evaluation of Unleaded Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel for Intake Valve Deposit (IVD) Formation and the Intake Valve Sticking (IVS) test developed by SwRI."

    "text": "Data Analysis Experience & Interested Research Areas\nBefore starting this program in Data Analytics, my experience was limited to a couple of statistics course in high school and college. At work, I work with a lot of time-series operational data from running tests but the extent of data analysis primarily consists of creating visualizations. With this being said, one area of research of interest is the automotive industry. Outside of testing cars during the day, I love diving into data related to sports so most anything sports related would be another interesting research area.\n\nInteresting Video Related to Data\nBelow is link to an interesting Ted Talk on “The Future of Data.” In this video, Tiago Santos touches on countless examples data has been used for in the past and contrasts them to examples of how data is being used in the present whether it be in business, pharmaceuticals, and sports.He goes on to explain how moving forward, data is ever changing with respect to its volume, value, variety, velocity, and veracity. Tiago concludes about the importance of having responsible people at the center of businesses and governments who are able to take in relevant data to make impactful decisions.\nThe Future of Data | Tiago Santos | TEDxEUBusinessSchoolBarcelona"

For the last ~10 years, I would travel the United States to compete in Ultimate Frisbee tournaments. As for endurance races, I’ve enjoyed running half marathons for several years but my primary achievements would consist of completing a full marathon in 2018 and then a half Ironman in 2023. I am taking a hiatus from the activities as I pursue my Masters but try to make time for golf, snowboarding trips, mountain biking, sand volleyball, etc."
